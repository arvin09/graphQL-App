GraphQL has 
Schema and Resolvers

Schema can be of Scalar and Object Type
Scalar are String, Int, Float and Boolean and ID

If we want to make Schema to be mandatory we should append an bang 
hello:String! or else null is allowed

If we want to return an Array of Strings
hello: [String] again same we can add a bang bout of the array to restrict nullable value

Resolver has three parameters parents, args and context
parents - parent of the entity
args - refrenence to arguments of entity
context - share data for entity

adding Filters to the data, if we have not scalar filters like object 
want to filter data based onSale and avgRating is more that 4
you need to add a input to schema and use it as a filter


Mutation is changing the data - Add Update & Delete
